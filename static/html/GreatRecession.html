Banks offered loans at a lower rate until they sold a lot of bad mortgages than the per capita. In August 2007, the Federal Reserve responded to the mortgage crisis by adding $24 billion in liquidity to the banking system. Federal reserve said agencies can work with lenders to work out arrangement on loans. It was too late though. This led to the collapse of large financial institutions and a $700 billion bailout by the U.S. government.
