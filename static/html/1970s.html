      <ol>
        <li>In 1973 a war in the Middle East made the Saudi Arabian Government halt all oil exports to America.</li>
        <li>Industrialization of agricultural countries made the Western World compete for resources which caused the steel crisis in 1973 which affected the manufacturing companies.</li>
        <li>Post World War II economic expansion was still happening but when the newly industrialized countries started competing it took away from the demand of the Western World's companies.</li>
        <li>The collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement (an agreement that was a guideline to commercial relations between Western World countries).</li>
        <li>The stock market crashed in 1973</li>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Manufacturing</h4></li>
        
            <p>3M is one of the most popular manufacturing companies in the world. The manufacturing industries were one of the most negatively affected industries during the 1973 recession.
             The price of steel increased and the price of oil almost tripled in the same year. </p>
          <li><h4>Consumer Products</h4></li>
          <p>Although everyday consumer products is very important to the lives of Americans, that didn't stop its stocks from crashing. They relied heavily on oil to keep their machines working and
            their trucks running.
          </p>
          <li><h4>Pharmaceutical Companies</h4></li>
          <p>The Pharmaceutical Companies like Pfizer were one of the very few industries that were not very affected by the depression, as their products are very important</p>
        </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-5"><h4>Unemployment Rates</h4>
      <p>The biggest effect of the recession was the increase of the enemployment rate. In the beginning of the 1973 the unemployment rate was at 5 percent and when the recession ended the unemployment rate was almost at 9 percent.
        This recession caused one of the worst unemployment crisis in US history.
